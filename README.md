# About the game
MagicMarbles represents a simple C#/WPF MVVMLight implementation in order to generate a small game. 
In addition the UI has been designed to use a simple FlatUI approach. 

# How to play
Click on a single marble which has neighbors the same color to remove 
them. You win, if you can pop all marbles and no ones are left. You lose if there are remaining ones.
The more marbles you can eliminate in one step the more points you earn.
